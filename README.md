This project has written without using redux, only local state and localstorage.
Was realized diffrent functionality (add item, remove item, upload data from server, public and private routes, pagination, sort data, searching data, validation form)
Was created custom hooks and hocs for these purposes.
P.S. I know that inline-styles is bad practice, but, to be honest, i used ones because of i wanted to save time
